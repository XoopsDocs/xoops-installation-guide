## Appendix 1: Working with the new Admin GUI \(our Dashboard\)

XOOPS 2.5 has as a default a new Admin GUI – the “Oxygen”, developed by Voltan \(Hossien Azizabadi\), and which is based on EXM created by Bit3CR0 \(Eduardo Cortés\).

Our new Dashboard is a major move forward toward improved ease of use for XOOPS users, with nice GUI and clear pull-down menus, as well with System Information and helpful Tabs.

1\) On the very top you see a Toolbar \(1\) with several buttons:
